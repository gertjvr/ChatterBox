ChatterBox project is built & tested continuously by TeamCity (more details [here](http://www.mehdi-khalili.com/continuous-integration-delivery-github-teamcity)). That applies to pull requests too. Shortly after you submit a PR you can check the build and test status notification on your PR. I would appreciate if you could send me green PRs.

The current build status on the CI server is <a href="http://build.gertjvr.com:8000/viewType.html?buildTypeId=ChatterBox_01BuildAndTest&guest=1">
